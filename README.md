# 2048 Maintenance
- Tasked to maintain and update an existing codebase of a 2048 game.
- Specific requirements and documentations are stated within the briefing document. 

Things I just did:
- Removed `module-info.java` from the codebase bc VSC references the library for me (may have to change when compiling for Eclipse) (also because JDK16)
